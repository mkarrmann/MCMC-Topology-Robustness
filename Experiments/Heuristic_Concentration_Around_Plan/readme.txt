This folder should have the metamandering around random plans / gerrymandered plans... code and experiments

todo:

1. Modify this to metamander around random partitions as well.

2. We want to show that two different metamanders result in histograms with a potentially 'large' seat spread. Can also play with the number of faces being metamandered.

3. Get the left out data in here if necessary? 


notes:

These were pulled in from https://github.com/gerrymandering-project/pipeline-tools
files: metamander.py,  facefinder.py (or facefinder2 ?)
and folders: graphs + jsons folder + extreme shifts

left out the plots folder and the shape file from data folder.
