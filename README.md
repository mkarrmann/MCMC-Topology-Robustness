# MCMC-Topology-Robustness

*TODO* fill this in more

Experiments demonstrating that MCMC methods for detecting gerrymandering are sensitive to changes in
the underlying graph topology in previous unexplored ways.

To reproduce our exact results, run `conda env create -f environment.yml` to create a conda environment
identical to ours. Additionally, ensure that the environment variable `PYTHONHASHSEED` is set to `0`.
You may follow the instructions [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#saving-environment-variables) for setting environment variables for setting environment variables in your conda
environment.
